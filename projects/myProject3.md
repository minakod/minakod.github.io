This assignment is for ICS464 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  The project was assigned to think some device to prevent babies or infants from being forgotten in a car for some reasons.  This device could be used with a car seat or something portable and so forth.  With the device, I needed to describe a concept of the car seat device and its conceptual model in detail.  Also, I needed to pick a metaphor for the device as most of the materials, devices or products came from not out of nowhere, but from some metaphors.  

My concept or idea for this device is a two-way signal pressurizes baby alert system with metaphors that are passenger seat belt warning sign which goes off when there is a pressure on the seat and the belt is not buckled, and a wireless keychain device, which the new car model has, that unlocks the car when a person with the device gets near and locks when he or she goes away.  I also think what kind of materials to use and how it works.  If I could actually build this device in the future, it would help parents from forgetting their babies and causing them to have a critical condition.

There are always things to improve on.  I might not need to make *new* product or material all the time, but rather need to think what I can improve stuff around me to help people.  Studying in a school and always facing a computer makes me think what I can do and think is something related to "computer."  However, it could be *anything*!  I can use the knowledge of computer languages and coding is not only for improving computer system, but also all the products out there in the world.  This project opened my eyes widely to the possibility of HCI.
