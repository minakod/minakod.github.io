This is a forth release note for continuing work on an app, called CRAM.  I was assigned to a group of four students to work on CRAM.  However, I am and will be working on this project by myself this semester to improve CRAM. For more information about CRAM, visit [here](https://cram-colleague.github.io)



## What I Worked On 

Last two weeks, I was working on fixing the design of menu bar, admin page and user profile page.



Here are two main functions that I worked on the last two weeks:



* Menu Bar: I changed the order of menus and added icons for each menu instead of just having words.  I was looking other sites and found out that most sites have a menu section to go to the profile page on the right side of the menu bar.  Therefore, I moved it around and put the profile section and logout button on the right side.  In addition, there would be the username under the user icon on the section. I also used a drop down function to clean the header.
* Admin Page: 


## The Obstacles

The obstacle that I faced was when I change the collection of a study session, I would need to change everything that uses that collection.  Automatically, it means that I would need to fix the add study session page, the edit study session page, and the study session page.  I took a time to figuring out what I needed to change and I spent a lot of time to test my function but adding some study sessions, deleting it and so on.



## What I Plan To Accomplish

What I plan to accomplish for next milestone (March 15) is:  



For the next two weeks, I would like to spend my time changing out the design of the pages.



* Menu bar: changing out the layout and the order of it
* Admin Page: changing the layout similar to the list of message and sent mail page. Being able to switch back and forth on the same page
* User Page: changing out the layout of the user page as well. Making the page easier to see study session and message page.  I would need to make the separate page for each section.
