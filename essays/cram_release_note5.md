This is a forth release note for continuing work on an app, called CRAM.  I was assigned to a group of four students to work on CRAM.  However, I am and will be working on this project by myself this semester to improve CRAM. For more information about CRAM, visit [here](https://cram-colleague.github.io)



## What I Worked On 

Last two weeks, I was working on fixing the design of menu bar, admin page and user profile page.



Here are two main functions that I worked on the last two weeks:



* Menu Bar: I changed the order of menus and added icons for each menu instead of just having words.  I was looking other sites and found out that most sites have a menu section to go to the profile page on the right side of the menu bar.  Therefore, I moved it around and put the profile section and logout button on the right side.  In addition, there would be the username under the user icon on the section. I also used a drop down function to clean the header.
* Admin Page: There was only one page for the admin page and containing tables of profiles, study sessions, and the reports from the users.  However, it would look bad if there are many users and study sessions.  So I created each page for each section, profiles, study sessions and reports so that the admin will have an easier time monitoring those.  For a study session table, it displays in the order of oldest to newest and only admin can see the past sessions.
* User Page: User page had a profile, study sessions that the user assigned.  And the message page was not connected with the user profile page.  I changed it to displaying the profile picture on the left top and a simple welcome message on the side of it.  There is also a menu bar for selecting schedule, message or report.  These parts will stay whenever page a user goes within the user-only page.  When it is on the user's schedule page, it shows whether the user is a teacher or a student for the specific section, and has date and time, so that the user can prepare if they need to teach or just think about the questions that they have.


## The Obstacles

The obstacle that I faced was finding right ui semantic that I can use and adjust pages.  There were a lot of copy and paste, but I had many places to revise small details.  Also, it took time for me to figure out making the limitation on the menu bar for non-user.  It wasn't displaying correctly at first.



## What I Plan To Accomplish

What I plan to accomplish for next milestone (April 1) is:  



For the next two weeks, I would like to spend my time changing the tutoerial pages based on the past modification.



* Tutorial Page: I will need to change the tutorial for the user page and for creating new study sessions.  
* Create Study Session: I would allow the user to choose whether they want to be a teacher of study session or students.  Now, the user can only be a teacher for the study session.
* Study Session Page: Since I allowed the user to create a study session as a student, I would need to add a button to be a teacher for the already created study sessions.
