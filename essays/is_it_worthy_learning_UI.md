## Why Do We Need To Learn UI

With HTML and CSS, we could build any website. Then why do we need to learn UI although it is like learning another programming launguage?  It is really worthy spending extra time to learn UI?

The answer is YES.  UI is a development framework that helps making a website look beautiful yet much simpler compared to just using HTML and CSS.  One of the differences from HTML and CSS is that Ui uses natural language. For example, when we want to develop two red buttons, we could say

```html

<div class="ui two red buttons">
  <div class="ui button">Button 1</div>
  <div class="ui button">Button 2</div>
</div>
```
