## Introduction to Meteor

My first attempt to working with Meteor was about two weeks ago by following tutorials of how to use Meteor.  There were a couple of tutorial assignments in the first week of interaction with Meteor.  Actually, I did not really understand what was going on in my codes.  I was copying and pasting the codes and following the instructions.  However, I found that Meteor could improve the security of the website and store the database within itself.

The website created with Meteor looked awesome and cool.  It had some tastes of UI Framework and new features from Meteor.  Before using Meteor, I was kind of satisfied with UI Semantic since it allowed us to create any website that we could imagine and is user-friendly.  I was able to create a website which was similar to an existing web page.  However, Meteor brought me a new level of software engineering.

The past week I was working on building a website called "Digits."  It stored contacts with name, address, telephone number and email address.  It also allowed the users to add another contact, edit and update the contacts, copy them and delete them.  I have not had time to modify and make it fancy, yet it has characteristics of UI Framework.

I found difficulties that there were a lot of pages in order to create a website.  It was hard to connect a page to fit pages. It could lead to crushing the site or that something would not work.  Also, I had a single space in between function calls and did not work.  This applies not only to Meteor but also coding in general, though.
