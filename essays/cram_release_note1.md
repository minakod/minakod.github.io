This is a first release note for continuing work on an app, called CRAM.  I was assigned to a group of four students to work on CRAM.  However, I am and will be working on this project by myself this semester to improve CRAM. For more information about CRAM, visit [here](https://cram-colleague.github.io)

## What I Worked On 

Past week, I looked back what my teammates and I have done so far and listed what I would need to do from now on.  There were some functionalities that were not working correctly, and also where I would need to change majorly.  I listed several issues that I would need to work on for the next couple of weeks.  
Since there were only five days till milestone 1, I fixed small issues.



* Study Session: There was a going button so that when users click it, it would add the user as a participant of a study session. However, it was showing although the users had not created a profile. Therefore, I edited not to show the going button when the users haven't created the profile.  
* Admin Page: Admin page contains the information of profile, study session and report. When there was no profile, the admin page only said that no profile has been created yet.  But there was a possibility that there would be no profile yet have a report from previous users, so I decided to have each section there on the page even though there is no profile.  
* Profile Page: There was a feedback from last semester says that the fonts of the name of users should be larger on the profile page.  I made bigger and change the position of the name to be displayed so that it would be easier to see the name.  
* List Of Profiles: When I checked each page in CRAM for various situatuion, such as when there are profiles and study sessions, when there are profiles but no study session and when there is no profile.  I noticed when there is no profile, the list of profiles page didn't say anything about it.  So, I added some description saying that there is no profile and the viewer of the page should create one :)

## The Obstacles

The obstacle that I faced was determining how long I would take to accomplish each issue.  There was not much time for this milestone, but I needed to start working something.  I decided to work on small things first and to fix minor issues that were left from last semester.  
Also, as I looked through the app, I found several places where I needed to fix and where I should have implemented.  I haven't look at the app from last semester and I needed to bring back my memory, yet it actually helped me to have a perspective of a third person to the app.

## What I Plan To Accomplish

What I plan to accomplish for next milestone (February 1) is:  



* Revising Calendar Functionality: There is a simple calendar functionality in CRAM, but it needs to fix because it is not connecting to the study session yet.  I will need to research about it and implement to CRAM since I wasn't in charge of this functionality last semester.  I would like calendar function to connect with a study session and being able to create and delete the study session.  The design of the calendar page is needed to change as well.  
* Notification System: There was a feedback about new functionality that users would like to have and that was notification system.  The users would want to be notified when new profile or new study session are created, or when there is a change in the study session that they are in.  Also, if the users is a teacher of the study session, they would like to have a notification when new students added to their sessions.
