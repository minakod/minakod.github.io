This is a first release note for continuing work on an app, called CRAM.  I was assigned to a group of four students to work on CRAM.  However, I am and will be working on this project by myself this semester to improve CRAM. For more information about CRAM, visit [here](https://cram-colleague.github.io)

## What I Worked On 

Past week, I looked back what my team mates and I have done so far and listed what I would need to do from now on.  There were some functionalities that were not working corrcetly, so I fixed those small issues. For example, in a studey session page, it shouldn't print a going button to join the study session if a user hasn't created a profile yet.  Also, I edited an admin page as well so that an admin can see what is happening on each category such as profile, study session and report.  Lastly, I worked on changing some fonts in order to look nicer in a profile page.

## The Obstacles

## What I Plan To Accomplish

What I plan to accomplish for next milestone (February 1) is revising calendar functionality. I will need to research about it and implement to CRAM.  I would like calendar function to connect with study session.  It will be needed to change a design of calendar as well.
Also, another functionality I want to add is notification system.  This comes from the feedback of last semester user.  Whenever new profile or study session added or new changes happen on the study session that users are going, it should notice them.
