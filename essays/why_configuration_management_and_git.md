## What & Why

Configuration Management is very important especially in order for software engineers to be able to work on a project as a team, and sharing and collaborating on the project are happening all the time in software development.  We need to know what configuration management is first in order to understand the whole picture of this problem.  What configuration management does is to attempt to identify and track all relevant elements of the configuration of a system, so that all possible errors can be identified and possible solutions to the problem can be found.  There are three major problems that configuration management needs to face and to approach: the double maintenance problem, the shared data problem, and the simultaneous update problem.

Personally, I have never worked on any group projects in software.  However, I have tasted the similar situations by Google has been doing good on Google Doc, Sheet, and Slide.  Multiple users can access and edit documents and so forth if a developer accepts them.  This would be useful for the long distance meeting, group presentation and so on.

## GitHub & Git

What do you think... *"Is GitHub popular becasue of Git?"* or *"Is Git popular because of GitHub?"* In order to answer this question, the definitions of GitHub and Git have to e clear.  GitHub is the most popular cloud-based software hosting platform, and Git is the most popular technology for configuration management.  Both GotHub and Git are used to address the problems of configuration management.  My understanding is that Git is a distributed version control system that keeps track of changes and updates, and it works perfectly with GitHub which allows users to share codes and to make a clone of a repository.  Therefore, I think *"GitHub is popular because of Git."*
