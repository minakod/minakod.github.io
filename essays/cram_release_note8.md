This is a eighth release note for continuing work on an app, called CRAM.  I was assigned to a group of four students to work on CRAM.  However, I am and will be working on this project by myself this semester to improve CRAM. For more information about CRAM, visit [here](https://cram-colleague.github.io)



## What I Worked On 

Last two weeks, I was working on deployment for the cram and on updating the cram home page.



* Deployment: I created the account on Meteor and deployed the cram on the galaxy.  In order to deploy on the galaxy, first I needed the database, so I created one for the cram on sandbox Mongo DB.  After having a database for the app, I can create or update settings file for Galaxy.
* Cram Homepage: I updated cram homepage so that all the information and photos are up to date.  Some functionalities are the same yet the design changed, so I needed to update most photos.  Also, new functionalities such as calendar are added to the user guide.



## The Obstacles

The obstacle that I faced was errors when I deployed onto the galaxy.  It keeps giving me an error when I start the app so I would need to stop running and change it some part.  I would still need to figure out the error to run my app on the galaxy correctly.

Also, in the user guide, I should not have all the photos of functionalities but choose which information would be helping the users and/or be attracted to them.  


## What I Plan To Accomplish

What I plan to accomplish for next milestone (May 15) is:  



For the next two weeks, I would like to continue working on improving the cram page that interviewer might take a look.




* Deploy on Galaxy: I will continue working on deployment and make it function on the galaxy.
* Fix Bugs: I will find major bugs that pop up during the deployment and fix important bugs.
