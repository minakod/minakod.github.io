This is a eighth release note for continuing work on an app, called CRAM.  I was assigned to a group of four students to work on CRAM.  However, I am and will be working on this project by myself this semester to improve CRAM. For more information about CRAM, visit [here](https://cram-colleague.github.io)



## What I Worked On 

Last two weeks, I was working on deployment for the cram and on updating the cram home page.



* Deployment: I 
* Cram Homepage:



## The Obstacles

The obstacle that I faced was figuring out how the one change affects the others.  At first, I was not noticing that I would need to change the user schedule page.  However, when I checked each page, I found that it was not showing the results.

Also, I was going to have some user tests.  Therefore, I needed to spend some time searching for what is the good way to test my app.  It suggested that it would be better to have well function mockup pages, about 5 to 7 testers of the app, a well-planed test plan that would take about 30 min of the participantsâ€™ time.  I just searched but not able to get the test plan yet.


## What I Plan To Accomplish

What I plan to accomplish for next milestone (May 15) is:  



For the next two weeks, I would like to work on improving the cram page that interviewer might take a look.



* Cram home page: I will make the cram home page as up to date with screenshots of working systems or pages with some realistic data.
* Deploy on Galaxy: I would try to build the cram on the galaxy and make it functions on brows.
* Fix Bugs: during the deployment, I will find major bugs that pop up and fix important bugs.
