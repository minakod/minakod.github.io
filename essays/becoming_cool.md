## My First Impression To Meteor

My first attempt to working with Meteor was about two weeks ago by following tutorials of how to use Meteor.  There were a couple of tutorial assignments in the first week of interaction with Meteor.  Actually, I did not really understand what was going on in my codes.  I was copying and pasting the codes and following the instructions.  However, I found that Meteor could improve the security of the website and store the database within itself.

The website created with Meteor looked awesome and cool.  It had some tastes of UI Framework and new features from Meteor.  Before using Meteor, I was kind of satisfied with UI Semantic since it allowed us to create any website that we could imagine and is user-friendly.  I was able to create a website which was similar to an existing web page.  However, Meteor brought me a new level of software engineering.



## How was Meteor?

The past week I was working on building a website called "Digits."  It stored contacts with name, address, telephone number and email address.  It also allowed the users to add another contact, edit and update the contacts, copy them and delete them.  I have not had time to modify and make it fancy, yet it has characteristics of UI Framework.

I found difficulties that there were a lot of pages in order to create a website.  It was hard to connect a page to fit pages. It could lead to crushing the site or that something would not work.  Also, I had a single space in between function calls and did not work.  This applies not only to Meteor but also coding in general, though. 

On the other hand, Meteor is so cool that it automatically refreshes the page and updates it.  We do not need to refresh the page by our own to see the updated page.  Also, it is good that Meteor can work perfectly with Javascript.  Since I have been trained to play with Javascript in these past two months, I'm a pleasure to see the work putting in together and make a cool website.



## The Architecture of Meteor

Although I had a hard time with many pages, it is one of the characteristics of Meteor as an application architecture.  Because it is spread out to each page, it would be easier to find an error compared with one-page having tons of codes.  The architecture is very nice and gives us an easier time to build a website.

With Meteor, I can create a website with cool features and a beautiful design.
