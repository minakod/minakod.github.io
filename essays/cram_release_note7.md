This is a seventh release note for continuing work on an app, called CRAM.  I was assigned to a group of four students to work on CRAM.  However, I am and will be working on this project by myself this semester to improve CRAM. For more information about CRAM, visit [here](https://cram-colleague.github.io)



## What I Worked On 

Last two weeks, I was working on adjusting study sessions and related pages.



Here are main functions that I worked on the last two weeks:



* Study Session: On the last release, I was struggling with adding sensei or student through this page, but I was able to figure out.  There will be up to one teacher for each study session, and if a study session is created by a person who wants to be taught, the user can choose to be a teacher for the study session.
* Create Study Session: Users can create a study session when they want to teach or when they want to be taught.  There is a selection that they can choose either a teacher or student.  It will pass the id of the user and on the study session page, it would look for the id and print out the name.
* Edit Study Session: As I added an option to be a teacher or student to the create study session page, I implemented the same option to the edit study session page.
* User Schedule: Due to the change in the option of being a teacher and a student, the function to look for which the users are in had to be changed.  It needed to be searched by the id of the users.



## The Obstacles

The obstacle that I faced was figuring out how the one change affects the others.  At first, I was not noticing that I would need to change the user schedule page.  However, when I checked each page, I found that it was not showing the results.

Also, I was going to have some user tests.  Therefore, I needed to spend some time searching for what is the good way to test my app.  It suggested that it would be better to have well function mockup pages, about 5 to 7 testers of the app, a well-planed test plan that would take about 30 min of the participantsâ€™ time.  I just searched but not able to get the test plan yet.


## What I Plan To Accomplish

What I plan to accomplish for next milestone (May 1) is:  



For the next two weeks, I would like to work on improving the cram page that interviewer might take a look.



* Cram home page: I will make the cram home page as up to date with screenshots of working systems or pages with some realistic data.
* Deploy on Galaxy: I would try to build the cram on the galaxy and make it functions on brows.
* Fix Bugs: during the deployment, I will find major bugs that pop up and fix important bugs.
