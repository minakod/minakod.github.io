## Why Do We Need To Learn UI

With HTML and CSS, we could build any website. Then why do we need to learn UI although it is like learning another programming language?  Is it really worth spending extra time to learn UI?

The answer is YES.  UI is a development framework that helps to make a website look beautiful yet much simpler to use compared to just using raw HTML and CSS.  One of the differences from raw HTML and CSS is that UI uses natural language, which is user-friendly. For example, when we want to develop two red buttons, we could simply say

```html
<div class="ui two red buttons">
  <div class="ui button">Button 1</div>
  <div class="ui button">Button 2</div>
</div>
```

Because we want "two red buttons," the class becomes "ui two red buttons."  Therefore, UI can help developers make a beautiful website that they want and save their time.

Another feature is that the developers do not need to make various HTML for each OS such as MacOS, Windows and Android. On the other hand, they only need one HTML page that can apply to all of them.  Users would have an easier time to look at websites with UI as well since it can adjust to their sizes of screens.  Therefore, UI is for both users and developers.

There is a difference in JavaScript as well when we use UI.  In UI, javaScript code is simpler than other frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap.  UI is such an user-friendly development tool and is worth to spend time and to put effort into learning.

## Is UI Better Than Other Development Frameworks?

Actually, I have never used other development framework.  However, I researched and found that UI was much easier than Twitter Bootstrap.  Honestly, Semantic UI was difficult for me and a little bit confusing.  I would like to continue learning it and want to get used to its structures and functions, even though it is hard because I know it is worth being able to use it!
